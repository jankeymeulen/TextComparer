# TextComparer

Small Java program to compare two texts, originally designed to be used to find quotations in a Byzantine anthology. It can quite likely be used to detect plagiarism between two texts as well

Graphical interface which allows easy navigation between corresponding parts in the two different texts. Uses the http://software.jessies.org/salma-hayek/ Java TextArea for this.

Probably very much can be done to improve this program and the algorithm which it uses.
